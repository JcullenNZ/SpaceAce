<h1>RollerBall</h1><br>
The rollerball tutorial was a refresher of the most basic parts of working with Unity.
My previous experience in game development was over the covid lockdown when I followed a Udemy course for 2D game development.
This was also my first time coding and was my first inspiration to take this education.<br>
The tutorial was easy to follow, and quickly a lot came back to me. I previously only experienced making 2D games, so working in a 3D space was quite different.
One difficulty I quickly came across was having to make planes mesh well with each other, and keeping everything on the same plane.
It was fun to see how quickly you can create a basic game with obvious goals, feedback to the player, and challenges.

I did not extend it much, only by making the level more difficult to traverse. I played with the gravity to change how the ball reacted to going off the edge of the ramps,
including needing to jump to get the last collectable.<br>

It could be interesting to see how 3D development can be made easier with the level creation, to change the
camera to make it easier to see if the collectable is aligned, and to play with the idea of the 3 dimensions being important. However, I am most interested in 2D development,
so will only dabble in this occasionally.
