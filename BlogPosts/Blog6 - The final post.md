<h1>Blog 6 - The final post</h1>
Finally, the project and the game are drawn to a close.<br>
After a lot of learning, and many late nights, I feel like I can deliver a game to be proud of. Certainly, it is not finished, and there are many things I would like to incorporate in the
future, but it does feel like there will always be one more thing.<br>

Here are some additions from the closing period of this projects.

Adding the player's name is essential to having an identity as the top SpaceAce. This is handled by the UIManager when the player enters a new game. This is easily then passed through the exisiting methods to display the player's name in the HUB in game and on the leaderboard when scoring a high score.<br>

When the player kills an enemy, there is a particle effect that plays showing the explosion.<br>

Sprites have been added to the player and the enemies, so they look distinct and in line with the style of the game vision<br>

The controller setup had to be refactored as the initial way of creating the game was not compatible with the Arcade machine it must be playable on. This required rebinding the keys and reassigning the control mapping. Fortunately, it was not too difficult as this game does not have a particularly expansive control scheme.<br>

The game is very well placed to receive on-going updates. I was not able to implement several areas I think would have made a major impact on the quality of the game. 
Some of these are:
<ul>
  <li>SFX for hits</li>
  <li>Animations on sprites including projectiles</li>
  <li>Health bars for the player and enemies</li>
  <li>Pickups that can increase firerate, heal, add shield, or add an extra weapon</li>
</ul>

I am proud to deliver this for you, and hope you will have fun proving the you are the SpaceAce!
